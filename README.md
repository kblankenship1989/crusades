# CRUSADES!!!!

This is an app to provide a simple, clean UI for maintaining your crusade Order of Battle and Crusade Cards for the Warhammer 40K 9th Edition Crusade system.

I am just learning React Native and TypeScript and wanted to build this as a project to help learn RN and TDD.  Feedback and suggestions for improvemtents are always welcome.
